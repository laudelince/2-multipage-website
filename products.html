    <p>Educational technology, a.k.a&nbsp;<em>ed-tech</em>, is one of my passions because of its <em>high leverage</em> in the pursuit of higher educational qualiy and its impact on people who want to <em>improve their lives through learning</em>. I have first-hand experience of how pivotal education in the attempt to reach ones objectives. I only hope to be able to multiply those oportunities of others.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <strong>imaginary</strong> producs of my imaginary ed-tech company include the following tools:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Learning coach</strong>: a machine-learning tool that harnesses the data collected from users by different devices to raise learner-awareness of distractors and healthy learning habits, as well as prompting metacognitive training tips as needed based on data collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized online courses</strong>: Just because two different people want to learn the same topic/skill, it doesn't mean that they both have the same intentions or objectives with the target knowledge. These courses would allow each learner to customize their experience by selecting the level of mastery desired and adjusting the format and amount of information according in the course according to the user's selection.</li>
