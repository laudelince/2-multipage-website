    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/employee">Merriam-Webster</a> dictionary, the definiion of the word "employee" is "one employed by another usually for wages or salary and in a position below the executive level". In my opinion, the employees of a company are a central pilar to institutional culture and quality as they are the gears that put every <strong>principle and objective</strong> into action.</p>
