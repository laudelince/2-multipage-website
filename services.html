    <p>Creating efficient distance educational resources is a difficult task in itself, even more so when the <em>human and economic resources</em> are limited. This is a challenge that predominates the educational technology field of underdeveloped countries. To mitigate this situation, my imaginary company offers the following services as ed-tech consultants:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Pre-configuration Assessment</strong>: Is your school or educational community planning to implement technology into learning? We can evaluate your particular context and make the necessary recommendations to reach your specific objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Configuration</strong>: Ready to implement our recommendations? Or do you already have a complete plan of your own? We can onboard your educational community with the necessary acquisition and setup, as well as necessary training for your in-house ed-tech professionals if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality assurance assessment:</strong> Have you been running our setup for some time? Or, have you been running a particular setup and would like to evaluate its efficiency? We can help you determine where your community stands towards meeting their objectives as well as make necessary recommendations/plan adjustments based on the results achieved.</li>
    </ol>
